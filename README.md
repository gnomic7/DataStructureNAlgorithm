# DataStructure and Algorithm

This repo is used to understand various data structures and algorithms - Besides, will try to optimize the same algorithm in terms of big O and explore the possibilities of writing the same code differently using ES6/Rust and other common languages - as we move on.

## How To Run Locally

`git clone git@github.com:gnomic7/DataStructureNAlgorithm.git` into your local file system.
`cd ESNext && node .` - should display the existing Linked list and a few other values for search and insert

Update the `index.js` and try `append`ing, `search`ing for any values.

## Happy Coding!
