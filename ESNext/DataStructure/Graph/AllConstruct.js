/**
 * Write a function `allConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts a target string
 * and an array of strings.
 *
 * The function should return 2D array containing all the possible ways that the `target`
 * can be constructed by concatenating the elements of the `wordbank` array.
 * Each element of the 2D array should represent the combination that construct the `target`
 *
 * You may reuse elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed
